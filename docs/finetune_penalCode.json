    "legalDoc": "Penal Code of Sri Lanka, Section 2(2) - Liability for offenses committed within and outside Sri Lanka, specifying acts done or omitted in Sri Lankan missions, government premises abroad, or where diplomatic immunity is enjoyed.",
    "output": "Under the Penal Code of Sri Lanka, every person is liable to punishment for acts or omissions contrary to its provisions committed within Sri Lanka. Extending this, Section 2(2) specifically holds every Sri Lankan national liable for offenses committed outside the Republic under certain conditions. These include: (a) acts done or omitted within the premises of a Sri Lankan mission or the residence of the Head of such mission, diplomatic agent, or any other member of such mission situated abroad; (b) acts within any premises occupied on behalf of or under the control of the Government of Sri Lanka or any statutory body established in Sri Lanka, situated outside the Republic; or (c) acts outside the Republic where the Sri Lankan national enjoys diplomatic immunity granted by a foreign state due to their diplomatic status. However, Section 2(3) clarifies that this does not affect the liability of such nationals under the laws of the foreign country where the act occurred."

    "legalDoc": "Penal Code of Sri Lanka, Section 3 - Abolition of Roman-Dutch Criminal Law; Section 4 - Certain laws not to be affected, preserving special or local laws and powers related to contempt of court.",
    "output": "The Penal Code, enacted as a general penal framework for Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon) effective from January 1, 1885, fundamentally reformed the criminal justice system. Section 3 explicitly abolishes so much of the criminal law previously administered in Ceylon as was known as 'the Criminal Law of the United Provinces' or 'the Roman-Dutch Law.' This marked a shift from the inherited Roman-Dutch common law to a codified system. However, Section 4 ensures that the Code does not repeal, vary, suspend, or affect any provisions of special or local laws. It also preserves the Supreme Court's inherent power, or that of any Judge thereof, to summarily punish persons guilty of contempt of the said court, as well as attorneys-at-law guilty of misconduct in the exercise of their profession. Thus, while establishing a uniform penal structure, the Code respects existing specialized legislation and judicial prerogatives."

    "legalDoc": "Penal Code of Sri Lanka, Section 5 - Definitions to be understood subject to exceptions in Chapter IV 'General Exceptions'; Illustrations (a) and (b) under Section 5.",
    "output": "Throughout the Penal Code, every definition of an offense, every penal provision, and every illustration thereof must be understood subject to the exceptions outlined in Chapter IV, titled 'General Exceptions,' even if those exceptions are not explicitly repeated in the relevant sections. This ensures a holistic interpretation where general defenses apply universally unless overridden. For instance, Illustration (a) notes that sections defining offenses do not state that a child under eight years cannot commit them, but such definitions are subject to the exception that nothing is an offense done by a child under eight. Illustration (b) provides that a police officer, A, apprehending Z without a warrant for murder, is not guilty of wrongful confinement because A was bound by law to apprehend Z, falling under the exception that nothing is an offense done by a person bound by law to do it. This principle promotes fairness by incorporating defenses like infancy or legal duty into offense interpretations."

    "output": "Section 19 of the Penal Code provides a detailed definition of 'public servant,' encompassing twelve categories to ensure broad coverage of government and quasi-governmental roles. Firstly, every person holding office in Sri Lanka by commission or warrant from the President or under the President's authority. Secondly, every member of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service. Thirdly, every commissioned officer in the naval, military, or air forces of the Republic. Fourthly, every judge. Fifthly, every officer of a court tasked with investigating or reporting on law or fact, making/authenticating documents, handling property, executing judicial processes, administering oaths, interpreting, or preserving court order, including those specially authorized by a court. Sixthly, every juryman or assessor assisting a court or public officer. Seventhly, every arbitrator or person referred a cause for decision by a court or competent authority. Eighthly, every person empowered to confine others. Ninthly, every government officer preventing offenses, informing on them, bringing offenders to justice, or protecting public health, safety, or convenience. Tenthly, every officer handling government property, surveys, assessments, contracts, or pecuniary interests, including those remunerated by fees. Eleventhly, every officer levying taxes or handling village/town/district documents for common purposes. Twelfthly, every person empowered to prepare electoral rolls or conduct elections. Illustrations confirm roles like Municipal Inspector, Superintending Engineer, Fiscal, and Grama Niladhari as public officers.

    "legalDoc": "Penal Code of Sri Lanka, Section 22 - Definition of 'Dishonestly'; Section 23 - Definition of 'Fraudulently'; Section 21 - Related concepts of 'Wrongful gain' and 'Wrongful loss'.",
    "output": "In the Penal Code, intent is crucial for many property-related offenses, with Sections 22 and 23 defining key mens rea elements. Section 22 states that whoever does anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person or wrongful loss to another does that thing 'dishonestly.' Wrongful gain (Section 21(1)) is gain by unlawful means of property to which the gainer is not legally entitled, including retention (Section 21(3)); wrongful loss (Section 21(2)) is loss by unlawful means of legally entitled property, including being kept out (Section 21(4)). Thus, dishonesty requires specific intent to benefit unlawfully at another's expense. Section 23 defines doing a thing 'fraudulently' as doing it with intent to defraud, but not otherwise—focusing on deceit for economic or other harm without the gain/loss specificity of dishonesty. These terms distinguish offenses like theft (dishonest) from cheating (fraudulent), ensuring punishment aligns with culpable intent rather than mere outcome."

    "legalDoc": "Penal Code of Sri Lanka, Section 27 - Definition of 'Document' with Explanations 1 and 2 and Illustrations; Section 28 - Definition of 'Valuable security' with Illustration.",
    "output": "Section 27 broadly defines 'document' as any matter expressed or described on any substance by letters, figures, marks, or combinations thereof, intended or usable as evidence of that matter. Explanation 1 clarifies immateriality of formation means or substance, or whether for court use. Illustrations include contract writings, cheques, powers of attorney, maps/plans, and instructional writings as documents. Explanation 2 deems expressions via mercantile usage (e.g., endorsements on bills) as if explicitly stated. Section 28 defines 'valuable security' as a document creating, extending, transferring, restricting, extinguishing, or releasing legal rights, or acknowledging liability or absence of right. The Illustration of endorsing a bill of exchange transfers rights to the holder, making it a valuable security. These definitions are pivotal for offenses like forgery, ensuring protection for evidentiary and proprietary writings."

    "legalDoc": "Penal Code of Sri Lanka, Section 32 - Liability for act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention; Section 33 - Liability when act is criminal by reason of criminal knowledge or intention.",
    "output": "The Penal Code addresses group criminality through constructive liability principles in Sections 32 and 33. Section 32 provides that when a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of their common intention, each is liable as if they did it alone—imputing shared responsibility for concerted actions. Section 33 extends this to acts criminal only due to criminal knowledge or intention: each participant joining with such knowledge or intention is liable as if acting solo with that mens rea. This ensures that accomplices cannot evade liability by claiming lesser involvement, promoting accountability in joint enterprises while distinguishing mere presence from intentional participation."
