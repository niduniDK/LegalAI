# Creating Consolidated Selenium IDE Test Suite

Since Selenium IDE cannot import entire folders, I'll create a single comprehensive test file that contains all tests in one place.

## Options for Managing Multiple Tests:

### Option 1: Single Consolidated File (Recommended)
- Create one large `.side` file with all tests
- Easy to import and manage
- All tests in one place

### Option 2: Import Individual Files
- Import each `.side` file separately
- More modular but requires multiple imports
- Better for team collaboration

### Option 3: Create Multiple Project Files
- Group related tests into project files
- Authentication.side, Chat.side, Documents.side, etc.
- Balance between consolidation and modularity

Let me create a consolidated version for you...
