### 1.2 Legal-Specific Metrics
- **Legal Entity Accuracy**: Correct identification of legal terms, sections, acts
- **Citation Accuracy**: Proper legal case and statute references
- **Factual Consistency**: Alignment with authoritative legal sources

## 2. Human Evaluation Framework

### 2.1 Expert Legal Review
**Evaluators**: Qualified lawyers/legal academics familiar with Sri Lankan law

**Evaluation Criteria** (5-point Likert scale):
1. **Legal Accuracy** (1-5): Correctness of legal facts and interpretations
2. **Completeness** (1-5): Coverage of all relevant legal aspects
3. **Clarity** (1-5): Understandability for legal practitioners
4. **Relevance** (1-5): Appropriateness to the question asked
5. **Citation Quality** (1-5): Proper referencing of legal authorities

### 2.2 Evaluation Questions
**Constitutional Law Examples**:
- Explain the separation of powers in Sri Lankan constitution
- What are the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 14?
- Compare the 1972 and 1978 constitutions

**Penal Code Examples**:
- Define culpable homicide vs murder with legal distinctions
- Explain the punishment framework for theft under different circumstances
- What constitutes a public servant according to the Penal Code?

## 3. Comparative Evaluation

### 3.1 Baseline Comparisons
Compare against:
- **Base Gemma 3 model** (without fine-tuning)
- **General-purpose models** (GPT-4, Claude)
- **Existing legal AI systems** (if available)

### 3.2 Evaluation Metrics for Comparison
- Response quality scores
- Legal accuracy percentages
- Citation correctness rates
- Response time/efficiency

## 4. Specialized Legal Evaluation

### 4.1 Legal Reasoning Assessment
**Test Cases**: Complex scenarios requiring multi-step legal reasoning
- Constitutional conflicts resolution
- Penal code application to hypothetical scenarios
- Cross-referencing multiple legal provisions

### 4.2 Edge Case Evaluation
- Ambiguous legal questions
- Recent legal amendments
- Conflicting legal interpretations
- Multi-jurisdictional issues

## 5. Practical Application Testing

### 5.1 Use Case Scenarios
**Legal Research Assistant**:
- Speed of finding relevant legal provisions
- Accuracy of legal precedent identification

**Legal Education Tool**:
- Effectiveness in explaining complex concepts
- Appropriateness for different learning levels

### 5.2 Real-World Validation
- Test with actual legal queries from practitioners
- Feedback from law students and educators

## 6. Error Analysis Framework

### 6.1 Error Categories
1. **Factual Errors**: Incorrect legal facts or dates
2. **Interpretive Errors**: Wrong legal interpretations
3. **Citation Errors**: Incorrect or missing legal references
4. **Completeness Errors**: Missing important legal aspects
5. **Clarity Errors**: Confusing or ambiguous explanations

### 6.2 Error Impact Assessment
- **Critical**: Could lead to serious legal consequences
- **Major**: Significantly impacts legal understanding
- **Minor**: Small inaccuracies with minimal impact

## 7. Quantitative Evaluation Metrics

### 7.1 Performance Metrics
```
Legal Accuracy Score = (Correct Legal Facts / Total Legal Facts) × 100
Citation Accuracy = (Correct Citations / Total Citations) × 100
Completeness Score = (Covered Aspects / Required Aspects) × 100
Overall Quality = (Sum of all scores) / Number of criteria
```

### 7.2 Statistical Analysis
- **Inter-rater reliability** between legal experts
- **Confidence intervals** for evaluation scores
- **Statistical significance** of improvements over baseline

## 8. Domain-Specific Evaluation

### 8.1 Constitutional Law Assessment
- Accuracy in fundamental rights explanations
- Correct identification of constitutional amendments
- Understanding of constitutional principles

### 8.2 Penal Code Assessment
- Correct application of legal definitions
- Accurate punishment prescriptions
- Understanding of legal procedures

## 9. Evaluation Tools and Implementation

### 9.1 Automated Evaluation Pipeline
```python
# Example evaluation framework
class LegalModelEvaluator:
    def __init__(self, model, test_dataset):
        self.model = model
        self.test_dataset = test_dataset
    
    def evaluate_bleu_score(self):
        # BLEU score calculation
        pass
    
    def evaluate_legal_accuracy(self):
        # Legal fact checking
        pass
    
    def evaluate_citations(self):
        # Citation verification
        pass
```

### 9.2 Human Evaluation Interface
- Web-based evaluation platform
