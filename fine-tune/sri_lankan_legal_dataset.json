          "content": "According to Declaration on Upholding Human Rights and the Rule of Law in Combating Terrorism: Declaration on upholding Human Rights and the Rule of Law in combating terrorism In the suppression of terrorism, states must give full effect to 11 principles. 1. Duty to protect - All states have an obligation to respect and to ensure the fundamental rights and freedoms of persons within their jurisdiction. States must take measures to protect such persons from acts of terrorism. Counter-terrorism measures must always be taken with strict regard to the principles of legality (actions taken to combat terrorism must be legal), necessity (there must be a need for it), proportionality (punishment must fit the action) and non discrimination (has to apply to all terrorist groups alike). 2. Independent Judiciary - In the development and implementation of counter-terrorism measures, states have an obligation to guarantee the independence of the judiciary and its role in reviewing state conduct. Government may not interfere with the judicial process or undermine the integrity of the judicial decisions. 3. Principles Of Criminal Law - States should avoid the abuse of counter-terrorism measures by ensuring that persons suspected of involvement in terrorists acts are only charged with crimes that are strictly defined by law. States must not apply criminal law retrospectively. Criminal responsibility of for acts of terrorism must be individual and not collective. In combating terrorism, states should apply and where necessary adopt existing criminal laws rather than create new, broadly defined offences or resort to examine administrative measures, especially those involving deprivation of liberty. 4. Derogations (where certain rights can be suspended /restricted for a particular period of time) - States must not suspend rights which are non - derogable under treaty of customary law. States must ensure that any derogation from a right subject to derogation during emergency is temporary, strictly necessary and proportionate to meet a specific threat and does not discriminate on the grounds of race, colour, gender, sexual orientation, religion, language, political or other opinion, national, social or ethnic origin, property, birth or other status. 5. Peremptory Norms - States must observe at all times and in all circumstances the prohibition against torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatments or punishment. Whenever such acts occur, they must be effectively investigated without delay and those responsible must be brought promptly to justice. 6. Deprivation of Liberty - States may never detain any person secretly or incommunicado and must maintain a register of all detainees. States must provide all persons deprived of their liberty, prompt access to lawyers and family members and medical personnel at the place detained. States have the duty to ensure all detainees are informed of the reasons for the arrest and any charges and evidence against them and are brought before a court. All detainees have a right to habeas corpus or equivalent judicial procedures at all times and in all circumstances, to challenge the lawfulness of their detention. Administrative detention must remain an exceptional measure, be strictly time limited and be subject to frequent and regular judicial supervision. 7. Fair Trial - States must ensure at al tiems and in all circumstances that alleged offenders are tried only by an independent and impartial tribunal established. The alleged offenders must be accorded a full fair trial guarantees, including the presumption of innocence, the right to test evidence, right to defence, right to effective legal counsel and right of appeal. States must ensure that accused civilians are investigated by civilian authorities and tried by civilian courts and not by military courts. Evidence obtained by torture or other means which constitute a serious violation of human rights against a defendant or a third party is never admissible and cannot be relied in any proceedings. Judges trying lawyers defending those accused of terrorist offences must be able to perform their professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper interference. 8. Fundamental Rights and Freedom - In the implementation of counter- terrorism measures, states must respect and safeguard fundamental rights and freedoms including freedom of expression , religion, conscience or belief association and assembly and the peaceful pursuit of the right to self determination as well as the right to privacy. All restrictions on fundamental rights and freedoms must be necessary and proportionate. 9. Remedy and reparation - States must ensure that any person adversely affected by counter-terrorism measures of a state or of a non-state actor whose conduct is supported or condoned by the state, has an effective remedy and reparation. All those who are responsible for serious human rights violations must be held accountable before a court of law. An independent authority should be empowered to monitor counter terrorism measures. 10. Non – Refoulment - States may not expel, return, transfer or extradite a person suspected or convicted of acts of terrorism to a state where there is a risk that the person would be subjected to a serious violation of human rights including cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, enforced disappearance or extrajudicial execution. 11. Complimentarity of Humanitarian Law - During times of armed conflicts and situations of occupation, states must apply and respect the rules and principles of both international humanitarian law and human rights law."

Athukorala V Attorney General (1996) 1 SLR 238 - It was argued that Article 4(e) is not exhaustive of the manner in which the franchise is exercisable and included pradeshiya sabha elections even though not expressly mentioned in that Article. The Supreme Court held that “it would appear from the above provisions that having extended the concept of sovereignty by adding Fundamental Rights and Franchise, parliament in prescribing the manner of exercising the franchise limited it to voting at the occasions referred to in Article 4(e). The wider meaning of Franchise which would include voting at the other elections such as elections of local bodies or provincial Councils had not been adopted. Local Authorities (Special Provisions) Bill - The Supreme Court stated that the mere fact that in Article 4(e) there is no reference to elections of Local Authorities does not mean that the franchise as contemplated in Article 3 would not extend to elections to local authorities. The constitution has to be looked at as an organic whole and in terms cannot be fixed to meanings they may have had at the time of enactment. In terms of the 13th Amendment, the powers vested in the Local Authorities have acquired constitutional recognition. As seen above it is evident that the Sri Lankan courts have tried to build a bridge between Article 3 and 4."

It was held that, the petitioner was prevented by the action of the police officer from proceeding with his journey. The petitioner was deprived of his liberty to go where he pleased. Thus this constituted an arrest as the freedom of movement of the petitioner was restricted even though no force or threat was used. Mahinda Rajapakse v Kudahetti (1992) 2 SLR 23 - The petitioner was to travel to Geneva to attend a conference. He was informed by the respondent that his bag will be checked at the Katunayake Airport on the information received that the petitioner was carrying fabricated information. Upon finding such documents, it was confiscated and the petitioner was allowed to proceed with his journey. The petitioner thus filed a case based on the ground of arrest. The court held that his freedom of movement was not restricted and thus Article 13(1) was not violated. Sirisena v Perera (1991) 2 SLR 97 - It was held that, whether or not a person has been arrested depends not on the legality of the arrest but on whether he has been deprived of his liberty to go where he pleases."

Thereafter many academics such as Blackstone, Jay and Hamilton, E. S. Crown, Marshall and L. J. M. Cooray further elaborated the concept. Accordingly, there arose 4 characteristics of the doctrine; i. The three branches of government ought to be composed of different powers. ii. There should be functional separation between the organs of government. iii. One organ should not control or interfere with the powers and functions of another. iv. Modern governments demand coordination of the various functions of government rather than a rigid separation."

The essence of the unitary state is that sovereignty is undivided-in other words, the power of the central government is unrestricted. The two essential qualities of a unitary state are; 1. The supremacy of the Central parliament 2. The absence of subsidiary sovereign bodies It does not mean the absence of subsidiary law making bodies, but it does mean that they may exist can be abolished at the discretion of the central authority.” Eg: Sri Lanka"

Any member of Parliament may give notice of a motion alleging that the President is permanently incapable of discharging the functions of his office by reason of mental or physical infirmity or that he has been guilty on one of the following five grounds: Intentional violation of the Constitution, Treason, Bribery, Misconduct or corruption involving the abuse of powers in his office, Any offence under any law involving moral turpitude, and setting out full particulars of the allegation or allegations made and seeking an inquiry and report thereon by the Supreme Court. The Speaker shall entertain such a motion only if it is signed by 2/3 of the whole number of members OR signed by not less than ½ of members and the Speaker is satisfied that such allegations merit inquiry and report to the Supreme Court. If the SC reports that the President is permanently incapable of discharging the functions of his office by reason of mental or physical infirmity or that the President has been guilty of any of the other allegations contained in such resolution, Parliament may again, by 2/3 voting in its favour, remove the President from office. Incompetence and inefficiency are not grounds for impeachment – the incumbent must be guilty of a legal wrong. The procedure involves moving from the Parliament to the SC, and then back again to Parliament. The first president to face an impeachment process was President R. Premadasa in 1992. In reality the procedure is lengthy and requires extraordinary majorities, making it virtually impossible to carry it through."

Growth of the powers of the British Parliament took place through a series of events including Magna Carta (1215), Case of Proclamation (1610), Bill of Rights (1689). The doctrine of Supremacy of parliament has been commented on by certain Jurists as follows – Dicey The concept of “Supremacy of parliament” embodies 3 basic propositions: Parliament can make or unmake any law whatsoever. No person or body is recognized by the law of England as having a right to override or set aside the legislation of parliament. The right or power of parliament extends to every part of the king’s dominion. De Lolme “It is the fundamental principle with English lawyers that parliament can do anything but make a woman a man and a man a woman.” A parliament can be considered Supreme upon the establishment of the following facts: 1. Parliament has the power to make or unmake any law whatsoever. 2. Parliament is not bound by its predecessors 3. Parliament recognizes no rival legislative authority 4. Parliament Acts are not subject to Judicial review 5. Parliament is not bound by International law 6. Parliament is not bound by Morality 7. There are no substantive limitations to the powers to the parliament 8. There are no procedural limitations to the powers of parliament"

Sections 3 and 5 of the Land Grants (Special Provisions) Act and Section27 of the Land Development Ordinance empowered the President to make such Grants/ dispositions of state land as constitutionally decreed in Article 33(d). This Bill was challenged on the basis that section 4(b) of the Bill, which made the president obliged to make grants upon the recommendation by the Minister was repugnant not only to Article 33(d), but Article 4(b) which attracted Article 3. The Supreme Court upheld the decision. In Re 19th Amendment to the Constitution (2002) 3 SLR 85 - Dissolution of parliament is a component of executive power of the people to be exercised by the president for the people. It cannot alienated in the sense of being transferred, relinquished or removed from where it lies in terms of Article 70(1) of the constitution. The final say even in the situation referred to in Article 70(a) to (c) remains with the President. Therefore, the amendments contained in clause 4 and 5 of the Bill constitute an alienation of executive power inconsistent with Article 3 read with Article 4 of the constitution and require to be passed by the special majority required under Article 84(2) and approved by the people at a referendum by virtue of the provisions of Article 83."

This meaning stresses the idea that the Law is Supreme. In modern day however, the parliament is recognized as the supreme power. The South African Law (Apartheid law) and the Special Commissions of Inquiry Act are contrasts to this first meaning. When Dicey gave these meanings in 1985, the primary function of the state was ‘preservation of law and order’ and handling of defence and external affairs. However, now the state, in addition to the above focuses on public welfare including education, Communication, health, agriculture etc. Therefore a state is vested with wide discretionary powers in executive."

          "content": "According to 13th Amendment to the Constitution (1987); In Re Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and Provincial Councils Bill (1987) 2 SLR 312: The 13th amendment was a result of an Indo-Lanka agreement which was an attempted to distribute policy making powers among the 9 provinces. The provincial councils were established through this amendment with the intention of solving the many ethnic problems that arose in the Northern and Eastern provinces at the time. In order to understand that judgment in relation to the 13th amendment [In Re Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and Provincial Councils Bill (1987) 2 SLR 312], one must first understand the following terms; DEVOLUTION Conferment of powers of the central government to a designated body in a region without relinquishment of the Central governments supremacy Hence Does not result in the permanent alienation of any part of the sovereign power of the State or its supremacy in all matters over the whole state Not permanent because The power to recall and resume the devolved powers exists in the sovereign authority in the state. DECENTRALISATION Powers of decision making of the Central government are exercised by officials who are a part of the Central Government. DELEGATION Grant power to do an act which is vested in the grantor to an agent usually subject to conditions as to its exercise and can be revoked at any time. Does the 13th Amendment impose a restriction on the legislative supremacy of the Parliament? Article 75 “Parliament shall have the power to make laws, including laws having retrospective effect…” The 13th Amendment introduced 3 lists; Reserved List [Article 154G (7)] A provincial Council has no power to make statutes on any matter set out in List II of the Ninth Schedule (Reserved List) Exclusively for Central Parliament Provincial Council List [Article 154G (1)] Every Provincial Council may, subject to the provisions of the Constitution, make statutes applicable to the Province for which is established, with respect to any matter set out in List I of the Ninth Schedule (Provincial Council List) Only regarding matters pertaining to their area (within its geographical boundary) [Article 154G (3)] This article sets out the special procedure to be followed by Parliament when making laws in respect of the Provincial Council list. [Article 154G (4)] Parliament can make law on any matter set out in the Provincial Council List where one or more provincial Councils request Parliament by resolution. Concurrent List [Article 154G (5)] Both the Parliament and the Provincial council can legislate after consultations (with each other). [Article 154G (6)] In the case of any conflict between Provincial Statute and an Act of Parliament, the Act prevails and the Provincial statute shall be void to the extent of inconsistency. [Article 154G (9)] If the Law existed prior to the 13th Amendment, this Law remains suspended and inoperative within the province so long as the statute id in force unless the Parliament decides contrary by resolution. After which the Act is valid It is therefore noted that some amount of legislative power is granted to the Provincial Councils by the 13th Amendment. The 13th Amendment Bill was thus challenged on the following grounds; 1. It will change the nature of a Unitary state 2. It will violate the Supremacy of Parliament In this case Sharananda CJ stated that, “the essence of a unitary state is that the sovereignty is undivided (In other words that the powers of the central government are unrestricted.). He also mentioned the essential features of a Unitary State – 1. The Supremacy of the Central Parliament 2. The absence of a subsidiary sovereign body He further stated that, although the Provincial Councils stand as subsidiary law making bodies, the can be abolished by the parliament at any time. With regard to legislative power that is granted to the Provincial Councils, Sharvananda CJ said, the legislative powers of Provincial Councils are not exclusive as – That power is subject to constitutional restrictions The bylaws made by the Provincial Councils are applicable only to those provinces The Parliament can amend or repeal this chapter regarding legislative power at any time. Hence, one can see that Provincial Councils are always subject to the Parliament and therefore Sri Lanka continues to be unitary state and Parliament still enjoys legislative Supremacy."

(Writ) No 358/2012; Attorney General v Bandaranayake and Others (SC Appeal 67/2013); Nixon v Unites States 506 U.S. 224 (1993): Preamble “… assuring to all people Freedom, Equality, Justice, Fundamental Human rights and the Independence of the Judiciary as the tangible heritage that guarantees the dignity and well-being of succeeding generations of people of Sri Lanka and of all the people of Sri Lanka...” Articles 107 – 111C Appointment and Removal of the Judges of the SC/CA Salaries of the Judges of the SC and CA on the consolidated fund. Performance and Discharge of other duties and functions by judges Appointment, removal and disciplinary control of Judges of the High Court. Interference with the Judiciary considered an offence. Independence of the Judiciary was discussed extensively in the following cases- i. Visuwalingham and Others v Liyanage and Others (1983) 1 SLR 203 ii. SC No.3/2012 C.A. (Writ) No 358/2012 iii. Attorney General v Bandaranayake and Others (SC Appeal 67/2013) iv. Nixon v Unites States 506 U.S. 224 (1993) at page 234 Higher Court Judges Upon taking into account all descriptions given above, the concept of Independence of Judiciary can be defined as; “A constitutional or legal environment which enables judges o discharge their functions and duties without fear or favour” Independence of the judiciary can be viewed as a logical consequence of the doctrine of separation of powers. It can be regarded as a concomitant of the Rule of Law. Since the Act of settlement of the British Parliament was passed in 1701, judges held office during good behaviour; their salaries could not be reduced during their term of office and only upon address of both Houses of parliament could the judges have been lawfully removed from their office. Consequently the Act may be regarded as the original source of the concept of independence of the judiciary as that concept is understood in modern constitutional parlance. This was related to later in the House of Lords decision in Toronto Corporation v New York Corporation (1938) A.C. 415. In the case of Senadhira v The Bribery Commissioner (1961) 63 NLR 313, Sansoni C.J. referred to the three principal pillars in the Temple of Justice as stated by Lord Atkin in the York Corporation case. The principals were as follows – a) The appointment of judges of the superior courts by the Governor- General. b) Judges of the Superior courts hold office during good behaviour subject to removal by the Governor- General on an address by the Senate and the House of Representatives. c) The salaries of the judges are fixed and cannot be reduced during their term of office. The framers of our constitution added a fourth pillar – d) The power of appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of judicial officers was vested in the Judicial Service Commission."

The jurists gathered in New Delhi in 1959 and arrived at 4 different conclusions which were embodied in 4 reports as follows – 1. The Legislature and the Rule of Law 2. The Executive and the Rule of Law 3. The Criminal Process and the Rule of Law 4. The Judiciary and the legal profession under the Rule of Law The Legislature and the Rule of law It is noted here that the legislature in a free society under the Rule of Law is to create and maintain conditions which will uphold the dignity of man as an individual. This dignity requires not only civil and political rights, but also the establishment of the social, economic, educational and cultural rights which are essential to the development of a personality. This also states that the powers of the legislature should be forced and determined to enforce fundamental constitutional provisions such as guaranteeing a free election and safeguarding the existence of an independent Judiciary. The legislature has the responsibility to – Abstain from enacting retrospective penal legislation. Not discriminate in its laws between citizens. Not interfere with the freedom of religious belief. Not impair the exercise of fundamental rights. The Executive and the Rule of Law There should be adequate safeguards against the abuse of power by the executive. Further it ensures a reasonable standard of economic security, social welfare and education for a mass of people. Criminal Process and the Rule of Law The report states that, if a citizen is charged with a criminal offence, he is entitled to receive the following minimal necessities – Certainty of the Criminal law (Absence of retrospective penal legislation) The presumption of innocence Restriction of powers of arbitrary arrest and detention The opportunity to know the charges for arrest Elimination of evidence obtained by discreditable means A fair trial open to the public Having measures for appeal No excessive punishments The government has to ensure that all these rights are available for every citizen in the country. The Judiciary and the Legal profession under the Rule of Law The Judiciary should be independent from the interference of the legislature and executive. Equal access of law should be available for the Rich and Poor alike. It is essential that representation is made available and litigation provided for those who are unable to afford the same."

They circulated some leaflets containing issues relating to the meeting. On the day of the meeting the crowd was dispersed by the police. The petitioner charged that their Freedom of expression had been infringed. Court held that article 14(1) was infringed and gave different examples of how freedom of speech and expression can be exercised. “... By word of mouth, writing, printing, pictures or any other mode. It includes the expression of one’s ideas through banners, posters, signs etc...” Amaratunga v Sirimal (1993) 1 SLR 264 - The opposition at the time organized a “Jana Ghosha” (vocal protest) against the then government by using musical instruments and other apparatus. At one particular place, the police interrupted and broke one musical instrument in the process of trying to stop the protest. The petitioner claimed that Article 14(1) was violated. Court held that the said article was violated and further gave examples to article 14(1)(a) Karunathilaka v Dayananda (1999) 1 SLR 157 - The government in power at the time used violence to stop people from voting. The question arose whether the right to vote at an election was a part of the right mentioned in Article 14(1) (a). Court held that , “The Freedom of ‘speech and expression’ guaranteed by that article should be broadly construed to include the exercise of the right of an elector to vote at the election. The silent and secret expression of a citizen’s preference between one candidate and another by casting his vote is no less an exercise of the freedom of speech and expression than the most eloquent speech from a public platform.” Viswalingham v Liyanage (1984) 2 SLR 123 - Court held that freedom of expression includes the freedom of the recipient (to hear). Fernando v The SLBC (1996) 1 SLR 157 - SLBC had been airing a particular program on radio for some time. This was suddenly stopped. The petitioner came to Court on the basis that SLBC had violated his freedom of expression and speech as he cannot now listen to what he preferred. Supreme Court took a different approach to that of Viswalingham’s case. It is also noteworthy that Justice Mark Fernando has recognized the right o information by interpreting article 14(1)(a) in a broader sense. Environmental Foundation Ltd. v UDA [SC(FR Application No. 47/04)] - Courts recognized again that there is a freedom of information inbuilt within Article 14(1) (a)."

An independent Judiciary is the surest protection against excess of power by the administration ... the British understanding of the separation of powers demands that the judiciary should be independent of the executive. ” S. A. De Smith “Judicial independence in a liberal democracy demands that it should be unconstitutional for the legislature to invade the domain of the judiciary by pronouncing judgment (as in a bill of attainder) or reversing a judicial decision with retroactive effect or enabling the executive to designate which judges shall sit to hear a particular case or abolishing a judicial office while it has a substantive holder, or reducing judicial salaries. It is clearly of great importance that justice be dispensed even-handedly in the courts and that the general public feel confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary ” Sharvananda C.J. “Independence of the Judges that constitute the Judiciary”"

The nearest it came to one was through Section 29 of the constitution. The first Republican Constitution (1972) enshrined a number of fundamental rights in section 18(1), all of which were to be operative within certain confines or limitations stated in section 18(2) which applied to all those rights equally. The present constitution (1978) has a separate chapter on fundamental rights (Chapter VI). The Bill of Rights in the present constitution is quite elaborate in the sense that the several rights enumerated therein are not subjected to blanket restrictions. While some rights cannot be subject to any limitation (by way of ordinary/ subordinate legislation or executive/administrative action), the other rights are subject to restrictions (prescribed by law) of varying degree. Such rights cannot be affected by the special majority in Parliament. Any attempt to affect such right will be successful only if people directly confirm such legislative action by way of approval expressed through a referendum. The present constitution recognizes the following rights – Religious Freedom – Article 10 and Article 14(1)(e), Freedom from Torture – Article 11, Right to Equality - Article 12(1), Personal Liberty – Article 13, Freedom of Speech and Related Freedoms – Article 14(1). Article 15 sets down a number of far reaching restrictions on fundamental rights, except those which are absolute and cannot be restricted."

The SC held that there was no violation of FR since the contributions were not compulsory, but merely voluntary. Christian Sahanaye Doratuwa Prayer Centre (Incorporation) Bill (4 SC CD 30) - This bill was challenged on the basis that it violated article 10. The bill provides for the setting up of a prayer centre and it also provides financial and economic benefits to its members. It was argued that the financial assistance will amount to inducement to follow that faith. Thus its main objective may be foreseeable conversion. Court held that the bill was unconstitutional and requires a 2/3 majority. The constitution guarantees to every person that the basic choice he makes with regard to his belief or would be taken with complete freedom without being exposed to any undue influence, allurement or fraud. Teaching sisters of the Holy Cross of the Third Order of Saint Francis in Menzingen of SL (Incorporation) Bill [SC Special Determination No 19/2003] - This bill had been aimed at propagating Catholic religion and to allure persons of other religions to convert. It is by this petition that the Court held that propagation of one’s religion is not a right recognized under Article 10. Also under Article 14(1)(e) it has the right to manifest, worship, observance and practice one’s religion. The constitution does not guarantee a FR to propagate religion. Even where propagation is expressly permitted, the entitlement does not extend to the right to convert others. The prohibition of Forcible Conversion of Religion Bill (SC Determination Nos. 2-22 / 2004) - It was sought to prohibit the conversion from one religion to another by using force, allurement or fraudulent means. It also meant that Article 14(1) (e) can be restricted by Article 15(7). Court recognized true evangelism as opposed to improper proselytism as a manifestation of religion. It is by this that the Court held that propagation of one’s religion is not a right recognized under Article 10. Also under Article 14(1)(e) it has the right to manifest , worship, observance and practice one’s religion."

The constitution of such a country would have the force of supreme law within its territory. In the case of Ibralebbe V The Queen, the Court of England stated that, as per the Ceylon Independence Act of 1947 (Section 10), the British Parliament shall cease to legislate for Ceylon, unless with the consent or at the request of Ceylon. By interpreting the said provisions, court held that the Ceylon parliament was in any sense subordinate legislature, but had the full legislative power of a sovereign independent state. The most important feature of an autochthonous constitution is its “independence”. 1972 Constitution (Article 1) – “Sri Lanka is a free, sovereign, independent Republic…” 1978 Constitution (Article 1) – “Sri Lanka is a free, sovereign, independent and Democratic socialist Republic…” The above implies that no foreign body can impose or influence the laws of Sri Lanka."

The constitution is not only the source that derives this power, but also the fundamental source which limits or regulates that power by imposing checks and balances on government institutions belonging to the Judiciary, executive and institutions, its authority, powers, functions and personnel should be kept apart without vesting it all on one person or one institution, which could lead to confusion. However, it is also reckoned that pure separation of power do not assist a government practically in functioning properly and may sometimes lead to a ‘constitutional deadlock’ if separation of power is strictly practiced."

Vide our rulings in SD 5/78, SD 4/80, SD 1/82, SD 2/82, the application of Article 4 however could be raised, still in any particular matter.

The nature of the limitations imposed upon the government depend on what the architects want to safeguard: They may want to ensure that the system of government cannot be changed arbitrarily and introduce a clause to say that the constitution can be changed only with a cetin majority or after a referendum. They may feel that a certain relationship between the legislature and executive is important. They may feel that the Judiciary should have a certain guaranteed degree of independence. They may feel that there are certain right that citizens have which not be tampered with. Thus, it supports fundamental laws. Ideas, attitudes and patterns of behavior that limit and regulate the power of government."

The petitioner was an alleged suspect of theft. However, Article 11 guarantees to each and every person irrespective of his/her status for getting recourse to the SC. Further it was held that the petitioner couldn’t identify the Police officers who tortured him. The court held that the petitioner does not need to identify the officers who caused him the injury, but the state is responsible for the conditions that are being complained of and in the event the allegations are proved, the state is liable to pay compensation to him. Deshapriya v Weerakoon (2003) 2 SLR 99 - The petitioner was a worker in the ship and was arrested on the allegation of theft. He was thereafter retained in the naval ship and tortured in an inhumane manner. The captain (Commander) however denied knowing that such torture took place. He also went on to state that, even if such an act did take place, he was not directly involved. Court held that the commander was under a duty to take reasonable steps to ensure that persons under his custody be treated in a humane manner. In accordance with the law, in the Forces, command is a sacred trust and thus discipline is paramount. Adhikary v Amarasinghe (2003) 1 SLR 270 - The petitioners were a lawyer and his wife. While the lawyer was travelling in his car with wife and child, a minister’s vehicle overtook this vehicle, forcefully stopped the lawyer’s car, pulled him out and assaulted him in the presence of his wife and child. The psychological trauma suffered by the wife was addressed in the judgment and it was held that the acts committed by the security officers were in violation of Article 11. Sriyani Silva v Iddamalgoda (2003) 1 SLR 14 - The petitioner in this case was the wife of the individual who was tortured and subsequently died as a result of those injuries. The petitioner’s husband was taken into police custody and tortured severely. He then files a FR case under Article 11. However, before the case was heard, he died due to the injuries suffered during the tortured period. The question then arose whether the next of kin can represent the person whose rights were infringed (after his death). The state took up the objection that Article 11 protects only the person whose rights have been violated and hence the wife cannot take up the matter. This was a dissenting judgment wherein the dissenting judge stated that if the wife cannot take the case forward, there will arise an absurd situation in interpreting the law and thus held that the wife (next of kin) had the right to file the case and seek redress."

Article 35 of the Constitution provides only for the personal immunity of the President during his tenure of office from proceedings in any Court. The President cannot be summoned to Court to justify his actions. But that is a far cry from saying that the President’s acts cannot be examined by a court of law. Though the President is immune from proceedings in Court, a party who invokes the acts of the President in his support will have to bear the burden of demonstrating that such acts of the President are warranted by law; the seal of the President by itself will not be sufficient to bear that burden.’"

Argued that this violated Article 3 read with Article 4(c) of the constitution. The supreme court upholding this decision held that “ this constitutes an interference with a judicial order and is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 4(c) read with Article 3 of the Constitution and must therefore be passed by a 2/3rd Majority and approved by the people at a referendum as provided in Article 83...” National Housing (Amendment) Bill - Bill sought to confer power on the commissioner of National Housing (CNH) to order payment of compensation for improvement effected by person to whom state land has been given by an instrument of disposition and where such instrument is cancelled. Supreme Court held that these provisions appear to confer judicial power on the CNH and the Minister. It was held that this was inconsistent with the constitution and may be passed only by a special majority as required by Article 84(2). Note: Court made no reference to Articles 3 and 4 although in other cases it did draw the connection. Parliament passed the law without acceding to the amendment suggested by court to make the Bill consistent with Article 4(c)."

Section 3 explicitly abolishes so much of the criminal law previously administered in Ceylon as was known as 'the Criminal Law of the United Provinces' or 'the Roman-Dutch Law.' This marked a shift from the inherited Roman-Dutch common law to a codified system. However, Section 4 ensures that the Code does not repeal, vary, suspend, or affect any provisions of special or local laws. It also preserves the Supreme Court's inherent power, or that of any Judge thereof, to summarily punish persons guilty of contempt of the said court, as well as attorneys-at-law guilty of misconduct in the exercise of their profession. Thus, while establishing a uniform penal structure, the Code respects existing specialized legislation and judicial prerogatives."

          "content": "According to British Constitution: Dicey was the first to give the rule of law a clear explanation. He gave 3 meanings to this concept. The meanings given by Dicey for the Rule of Law contrasted with a system of government based on the exercise of power by person in authority with “wide, arbitrary or discretionary powers of constraint. € No man is punishable or can be made to suffer in body or goods, except for a distinct breach of the law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary courts of the land. This meaning stresses the idea that the Law is Supreme. In modern day however, the parliament is recognized as the supreme power. The South African Law (Apartheid law) and the Special Commissions of Inquiry Act are contrasts to this first meaning. When Dicey gave these meanings in 1985, the primary function of the state was ‘preservation of law and order’ and handling of defence and external affairs. However, now the state, in addition to the above focuses on public welfare including education, Communication, health, agriculture etc. Therefore a state is vested with wide discretionary powers in executive. € Everyman, whatever his rank or condition, is subject to the ordinary law of the state and amendable to the Jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals. This gives the idea that every man is equal before the law. However, certain public citizens have received certain privileges of immunity from the legal process. (Ex: President of the Republic, Ambassadors, Judges) There is a need for special tribunals and courts in a modern state provided they are independent. € The constitution of England is the result of the ordinary law of the land. The constitution is judge-made law An unwritten constitution doesn’t guarantee Fundamental Rights as much as in a written Constitution."

An independent Judiciary is the surest protection against excess of power by the administration ... the British understanding of the separation of powers demands that the judiciary should be independent of the executive. ” S. A. De Smith - “Judicial independence in a liberal democracy demands that it should be unconstitutional for the legislature to invade the domain of the judiciary by pronouncing judgment (as in a bill of attainder) or reversing a judicial decision with retroactive effect or enabling the executive to designate which judges shall sit to hear a particular case or abolishing a judicial office while it has a substantive holder, or reducing judicial salaries. It is clearly of great importance that justice be dispensed even-handedly in the courts and that the general public feel confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary ” Sharvananda C.J. - “Independence of the Judges that constitute the Judiciary” On taking into account all descriptions given above, the concept of Independence of Judiciary can be defined as; “A constitutional or legal environment which enables judges o discharge their functions and duties without fear or favour” Independence of the judiciary can be viewed as a logical consequence of the doctrine of separation of powers. It can be regarded as a concomitant of the Rule of Law. Since the Act of settlement of the British Parliament was passed in 1701, judges held office during good behaviour; their salaries could not be reduced during their term of office and only upon address of both Houses of parliament could the judges have been lawfully removed from their office. Consequently the Act may be regarded as the original source of the concept of independence of the judiciary as that concept is understood in modern constitutional parlance. This was related to later in the House of Lords decision in Toronto Corporation v New York Corporation (1938) A.C. 415. In the case of Senadhira v The Bribery Commissioner (1961) 63 NLR 313, Sansoni C.J. referred to the three principal pillars in the Temple of Justice as stated by Lord Atkin in the York Corporation case. The principals were as follows – a) The appointment of judges of the superior courts by the Governor- General. b) Judges of the Superior courts hold office during good behaviour subject to removal by the Governor- General on an address by the Senate and the House of Representatives. c) The salaries of the judges are fixed and cannot be reduced during their term of office. The framers of our constitution added a fourth pillar – d) The power of appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of judicial officers was vested in the Judicial Service Commission."

The question for the Court is whether there was material for a reasonable officer to cause the arrest. Proof of the commission of the offence is not required. A reasonable suspicion or reasonable complaint of the commission of the offence will suffice. The test is an objective one. Police are not required before acting to have anything like a prima facie case for convicting. A suspicion is proved to be reasonable if the facts disclose that it was founded on matters within the police officers own knowledge or on the statements made by some other persons in a way which justify him giving them credit. Yapa v Bandaranaike (1988) 1 SLR 63 - Court held that a person can be arrested without a warrant in 2 circumstances; In an instance where there is reasonable suspicion. If the reason for arrest has been informed previously to the person for committing an cognizable offence. Channa Peiris v AG (1994) 1 SLR 1 - Sets out the criteria an officer must follow prior to making an arrest. The officer making the arrest cannot act on suspicion founded on mere conjecture or vague surmise. His information must give rise to reasonable suspicion that the suspect was concerned in the commission of an offence... The suspicion must not be of an uncertain and vague nature but of a positive and definite character providing reasonable ground for suspecting that the person arrested was concerned in the commission of an offence. Vinayagamoorthi Vimalendran v Army General (1997) 1 SLR 113 - It was held that the question whether the arrest was done following the du process or not is not decided by the offence he was committing at the time of the arrest and not by the offences that are revealed by the investigations carried out after the arrest."

They query whether the Westminster tradition of responsibility really has any bearing in the Sri Lankan context. As the President holds office on a separate mandate from the Parliament, he is directly responsible to the people and not their representatives. A PM is sometimes referred to as a primus inter pares – but the President is akin to that of a primus solus."

The Supreme Court, with Chief Justice Neville Samarakoon stated the following: ‘Actions of the executive are not above the law and certainly can be questioned in a court of law.  Article 35 of the Constitution provides only for the personal immunity of the President during his tenure of office from proceedings in any Court. The President cannot be summoned to Court to justify his actions. But that is a far cry from saying that the President’s acts cannot be examined by a court of law. Though the President is immune from proceedings in Court, a party who invokes the acts of the President in his support will have to bear the burden of demonstrating that such acts of the President are warranted by law; the seal of the President by itself will not be sufficient to bear that burden.’"

This ensures a holistic interpretation where general defenses apply universally unless overridden. For instance, Illustration (a) notes that sections defining offenses do not state that a child under eight years cannot commit them, but such definitions are subject to the exception that nothing is an offense done by a child under eight. Illustration (b) provides that a police officer, A, apprehending Z without a warrant for murder, is not guilty of wrongful confinement because A was bound by law to apprehend Z, falling under the exception that nothing is an offense done by a person bound by law to do it. This principle promotes fairness by incorporating defenses like infancy or legal duty into offense interpretations."

Even though we have drawn inspiration from the French and US Presidential system, these two individuals must exercise more restraint when in office. V.K. Nanyakkara states as follows, ‘Once believed to be the change this country badly needed, the executive presidency poses an impediment to the principles of democracy upon which this republic was founded.’ The allocation of the President of the portfolio of finance has also been criticized as it is traditionally within the purview of elected members of Parliament. A minister of finance who is present in parliament and answerable to them, is deemed more suitable. Juan Linz states that the presidential system encourages a personalized style of politics that favours charismatic politicians and populists and that such is at odds with the basic norms of constitutionalism. As the President is elected by an entire country, he believes he is legitimately entitled to do anything – and thus gives him an exaggerated sense of his own importance. A coalition or power sharing government can rarely be successful, given the limited constitutional role of the Prime Minister, and as soon as the President decided to utilize his full powers, such a government will collapse. This was seen twice in our history."

Wickramanayake V the State (1978-79-80) 1 SLR 299 - The petitioner that the entrenched article 3 attracts article 4 and therefore all the fundamental rights recognized in the constitution are entrenched. The court did not go to consider the situation that would have arisen since it was found that the restrictions imposed upon the fundamental rights which were challenged was in conformity with Article 15(5) and 15 (7). Development Councils Bills - Clause 24 of the Bill gave power to the development council to levy taxes/rates determined by the council with the approval of the Minister. Article 148 of the constitution allows taxes to be imposed only under the authority of the parliament. Court held that the Bill violates Article 1448 which declares that taxes can be imposed only under the authority of parliament and that it contravenes Article 76 and is inconsistent with Article 3. In Re 13th Amendment to the constitution and the Provincial Councils Bill (1987) 2 SLR 312 - Majority judgment: “Article 4 is not independently entrenched. To the extent that a principle contained or is a necessary corollary or concomitant of Article 3, a constitutional amendment inconsistent with such principle will require a referendum in terms of Article 83, not because article 4 is entrenched, but because it may impinge on Article 3.” Minority Judgment: “this court has in fact ruled in a series of cases that Article 4 had to be read along with Article 3. Vide our rulings in SD 5/78, SD 4/80, SD 1/82, SD 2/82, the application of Article 4 however could be raised, still in any particular matter. It is by the same token our rulings would cover any article in the constitution which the court considers as being linked with any of the entrenched articles. So as to constitute a basic feature of the constitution.” In Re 18th Amendment to the Constitution (2002) 3 SLR 71 - Under clause 2 (proposed Article 41FF of the Bill which empowers the council to make rules of procedure and guidelines to be followed by it, the council is required before gazetting the rules (whereupon they would come into effect) to communicate such rules to parliament. No approval of parliament is required in the case of the constitution. Hence, clause 2 alienates the legislative power of the people in violation of Article 4(a); in the circumstances clause 2 requires to be passed by the special majority required under Article 84(2) by virtue of Article 83."

All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law. This is also included in the preamble to the constitution. The concept of equality before the law is also recognized in Article 7 of the UNDHR and Article 26 of the International Charter of Civil and Political Rights. This right is not absolute and hence can be restricted under the circumstances set out in Articles 15(7) and 15 (8). This article contains 2 aspects; Equality before the law (negative aspect) Requires that the law of the land be enforced against all persons equally without any distinction made on any ground whatsoever. Equal protection of the law (Positive aspect) Demands that all persons are entitled to stand before the law on equal terms, to enjoy the same rights belonging to and to bear the same burdens as are imposed on the other persons in a like situation. All persons are not by nature, attainment or circumstance in the same position. Therefore it is wrong to insist that every law must have a universal application or that in the matter of administration of justice no distinction must be made between individuals or groups of individuals. What the equality provision prohibits is ‘discrimination’, i.e. treatment of a person in a manner prejudicial to him as compared to another person in similar circumstances. It does not prohibit ‘reasonable classification’ (grouping of a person or things based on some real and substantive distinction bearing a just and reasonable relation to the object sought to be attained)."

Article 3, “In the Republic of Sri Lanka; Sovereignty is in the people and is inalienable” Article 4, “The Sovereignty of the people is exercised through a National State Assembly …” Sovereignty contained only the government powers; Legislative, executive and Judiciary. Fundamental Rights were not identified as a part of sovereignty and no mechanism to challenge FR violations. No Judicial review of legislation. The constitutional courts can review bills inconsistent with the constitution, but NSA was not bound to enforce the decision. The NSA had sole authority. Constitutional provisions including sovereignty were not entrenched. NSA could change any provision with a 2/3rd majority. There were no provisions for the requirement of a referendum. Sovereign power was nominally vested with the people. The concept was justiciable. There was no mechanism for people to exercise their sovereign power except by the NSA. Thus it can be stated that, under the 1972 constitution sovereignty of the people was nominally recognized but the power was essentially with the NSA."

The Soulbury Constitution (1947) did not include a comprehensive Bill of Rights, but Section 29 provided limited protections against religious and communal discrimination. The First Republican Constitution of 1972 introduced fundamental rights in Section 18(1), subject to blanket restrictions in Section 18(2).\n\nThe current framework is provided by the Second Republican Constitution of 1978, which dedicates Chapter VI to Fundamental Rights. Article 14(1)(a) guarantees every citizen 'the freedom of speech and expression including publication.' This encompasses the absence of restraint on communicating ideas, essential for personal development and democratic society. It includes various forms: word of mouth, writing, printing, pictures, banners, posters, signs, and even symbolic actions like protests and voting.\n\nHowever, this right is not absolute. It can be restricted by law for reasons including parliamentary privilege (Art. 15(2)), contempt of court, defamation, incitement to offense (Art. 15(3)), public order or national security (Art. 15(4)), and others as specified in Articles 15(5-6,8).\n\nKey judicial interpretations include:\n- Joseph Perera v AG (1992) 1 SLR 199: Freedom of speech infringed by police dispersing a meeting; includes expression through banners, posters, etc.\n- Amaratunga v Sirimal (1993) 1 SLR 264: Vocal protests and use of musical instruments protected.\n- Karunathilaka v Dayananda (1999) 1 SLR 157: Voting as an exercise of free speech.\n- Viswalingham v Liyanage (1984) 2 SLR 123: Includes freedom of the recipient to hear.\n- Fernando v SLBC (1996) 1 SLR 157: Implicit right to information; stopping a radio program violated listener's rights.\n- Environmental Foundation Ltd. v UDA (SC FR 47/04): Recognized freedom of information within Article 14(1)(a).\n\nExceptions must be narrowly construed, as emphasized in Abeysekara v Ariya Rubasinghe (2000) 1 SLR 314, to preserve the democratic essence of the Constitution."

Section 22 states that whoever does anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person or wrongful loss to another does that thing 'dishonestly.' Wrongful gain (Section 21(1)) is gain by unlawful means of property to which the gainer is not legally entitled, including retention (Section 21(3)); wrongful loss (Section 21(2)) is loss by unlawful means of legally entitled property, including being kept out (Section 21(4)). Thus, dishonesty requires specific intent to benefit unlawfully at another's expense. Section 23 defines doing a thing 'fraudulently' as doing it with intent to defraud, but not otherwise—focusing on deceit for economic or other harm without the gain/loss specificity of dishonesty. These terms distinguish offenses like theft (dishonest) from cheating (fraudulent), ensuring punishment aligns with culpable intent rather than mere outcome."

In other words, a federal state can be two or more bodies with one power. Each body has exclusive power in each area within its power. Federal state may be subdivided into – 1. States where the powers allocated to the federal government are specifically stated in the constitution (while the remaining powers are left to the constituent states). Eg: USA, Switzerland and Australia 2. States where the powers of the constituent states or provinces are specified and the residuary power is vested in the Central government. Eg: Canada In the case of Re thirteenth Amendment (1987) 2 Sri L.R. 312: “The existence of co ordinate authorities independent of each other is the gist of the federal principle. The federal government is the sovereign on some matters and the state governments are sovereign in others. Each within its own sphere exercises its powers without control from the other and neither is subordinate to the other.” It must be noted that it is the constitution that determines whether a state is unitary or federal. In most countries it is clearly visible, however, in certain countries it is not so. Eg: India (India has a basic structure of a federal state, but in respect of the powers possessed by the central government it displays more characteristics of a unitary state. For this reason, India is referred to as a Quasi – Federal State."

As the President is dominant, writers suggest that the Cabinet is less collegial but a support team. The only restriction is that the Cabinet must consist of parliamentary members. Yet, one way out of this is bringing an outsider through the national list and appointing him a minister. As per Article 44 (2) the President can assign to himself any amount of portfolios, any subject or function."

Section 32 provides that when a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of their common intention, each is liable as if they did it alone—imputing shared responsibility for concerted actions. Section 33 extends this to acts criminal only due to criminal knowledge or intention: each participant joining with such knowledge or intention is liable as if acting solo with that mens rea.

Article 3, “In the Republic of Sri Lanka sovereignty is in the People and is inalienable. Sovereignty includes powers of the government, Fundamental Rights and Franchise.” Article 4 depicts how the people shall exercise their sovereign power. Legislative Power shall be exercised by parliament and by people at a referendum [4(a)]. Executive power shall be exercised by the president [4(b)]. Judicial power shall be exercised by parliament through courts and tribunals [4(d)]. FR and Franchise shall be exercised by the people directly. Franchise can be used at a presidential election or parliamentary election and referendum [4(e)]. Supreme Court is vested with the Fundamental Rights Jurisdiction under Article 126. Therefore the Supreme Court can protect the rights and freedoms of the people. If there is a violation of FR, people can exercise their Sovereign power by applying to the SC for relief. Supreme Court has Constitutional Jurisdiction. The legislature is prevented from enacting laws inconsistent with the constitution. Therefore the parliament cannot alter the powers given to it by the people without the consent of the people. Article 83 states that certain articles [1,2,3,6,7,8,9,10,11,30(2), 62(2), 83] of the constitution are extremely important and cannot be altered without the approval of the people at a referendum. This again, illustrates the sovereignty exercised directly by the people. Article 85 provides for Referendum. The President shall submit bills to people at a referendum if it is in accordance with article 85(1). According to Article 85(2), the president shall submit bills to people which is not for amend, repeal, or inconsistent with the constitution, but which is rejected by parliament. This is clear proof that the people have ultimate sovereign authority as they have the power to override the parliament by approving such a bill. Thus absolute power is vested with the people."

It was based on the concept “King can do no wrong”. However it was later found that setting up a legal system to regulate is far better than giving supreme power to an individual person. Many Historians and Jurists have explained the Rule of Law – Aristotle “The Rule of law is better than that formulated by any individual” Bracton “The King himself ought not to be subject to man, but subject to God and the law, because the law makes him king” Dicey was the first to give the rule of law a clear explanation. He gave 3 meanings to this concept. The meanings given by Dicey for the Rule of Law contrasted with a system of government based on the exercise of power by person in authority with “wide, arbitrary or discretionary powers of constraint. The essence of Rule of law as explained by Prof. Goodhart is as follows- “Public officers should be governed by law which limits their powers.” Jennings has tried to equate the Rule of law with democracy. It was found that the above explanations were brought out with a view of avoiding the mistakes that Darcy made."

Criteria for selection were specified by the cabinet. Under the said criteria, 3000 applicants were eligible. out of which 1000 were selected by the discretionary powers exercised by the Minister in charge of the Scheme. This discretion of power was a violation of Article 12(1). It vests arbitrary power in a MP to select 1000 persons out of a vast number satisfying the eligibility criteria. It was decided in this case that courts adopted a classification in relation to Article 12(1) – Classification should be Intelligible Differentia – which distinguishes persons from another group. The differentia must have a relation to the object sought to be achieved. Perera v UGC [FRD (1) 103] - At the time the Advanced Level Examination was first introduced (1979), two examinations were held (Old syllabus and new syllabus). The UGC adopted a system of allocating available places on a ratio 7.2: 2.8. The question was whether the classification was rationally related to the objective of selecting best students. The SC held that by deciding to have a common basic aggregate in both examinations, those eligible from both sources were integrated into one class and thereby made equals. Thereafter they cannot be discriminated against by reference to the original sources. There was no material tom show that one examination was superior. Rampillai v Minister of Public Administration (1991) 1 SLR 11 - The question was whether ethnicity can be a deciding factor in granting promotions to Customs officers of equal rank. It was held that, “once the appointees are ‘clubbed’ together, into a common stream of service, they cannot be treated differently thereafter, for the purpose of promotion, by differentiating them on ethnic grounds.” If it was so done, it would have constituted an infringement of Article 12. Shafeek v Secretary, Public Service Commission [SC (F/R) 249/96, SCM 19.11.1998] - It was held that the principle of ethnic quotas in relation to the recruitment to the public service is an infringement of Article 12. Perera v Jayawickrama (1985) 1 SLR 285 - The petitioner was sent compulsory retirement maliciously and without just cause. Sharvananda CJ stated that, the retirement was ‘unreasonable’ and ‘unjustifiable’ and that it lacked ‘bona fides’. However, his FR guaranteed by Article 12 had not been violated because he failed to cite instances of another person of under his circumstances having been treated differently. Wimalarathna J, provided a different view stating that, the application of a wrong procedure in taking disciplinary action against the petitioner by itself established discrimination."

The Supreme Court, with Chief Justice Neville Samarakoon stated the following: ‘Actions of the executive are not above the law and certainly can be questioned in a court of law.  Article 35 of the Constitution provides only for the personal immunity of the President during his tenure of office from proceedings in any Court. The President cannot be summoned to Court to justify his actions. But that is a far cry from saying that the President’s acts cannot be examined by a court of law. Though the President is immune from proceedings in Court, a party who invokes the acts of the President in his support will have to bear the burden of demonstrating that such acts of the President are warranted by law; the seal of the President by itself will not be sufficient to bear that burden.’"

Karunatilleke v Dissanayake (1999) 1 SLR 157 - Further clarified that which was discussed in the previous case. “… It imposes no bar whatsoever on proceedings (a) against him when he is no longer in office… Immunity is a shield for the doer, not for the act.” Senarath v Chandraratne, Commissioner of Excise and Others (1995) 1 SLR 209 - President’s acts were relied on by the commissioner of Excise to justify his acts. “in the instant case the petitioner has not filed proceedings in a court seeking relief against the President.

          "content": "According to Second Republican Constitution of Sri Lanka (1978): The concept of ROL is not only of great antiquity but also one of the predominant concepts of constitutionalism. In essence, the concept suggests that society should be governed by law alone and all must be equally subjected to the law. For a government to be conducted under the law it is essential that there are both judicial and parliamentary procedures which ensure that the government only uses those powers that have been conferred on them and the government is accountable to the people through Parliament. But if the executive have excess power over proceedings of Parliament and also the ability to influence the legislature and Judiciary, such powers derogate from Separation of Powers. The Judiciary though separate from legislature constitutionally, is subordinate to the law making Parliament. The intentions of the Parliament was, as always to adhere to the ROL is borne in mind by the Judges in deciding FR cases. Judges or no judicial office can declare an Act of Parliament invalid. Validity of an Act passed by the legislature is unchallengeable and Parliament at any given time can overturn a judicial decision by enacting a new Act because Parliament has the ultimate power to make laws. Thus we can argue that ROL cannot stand alone without Constitutionalism and vice versa! For the ROL to be adhered to there should be a separation between the law makers and law enforcement. Thus constitutionalism demands a clearly defined separation of the two concepts, sovereignty and the government. How the FRs are protected in the constitution by itself is of utmost importance. ROL demands interpretation of Acts of parliament bearing in mind the intentions of parliament, but the constitutional restrictions placed on the government power also has to be observed as a part of ROL and to uphold constitutionalism. In safeguarding FRs, the idea of constitutionalism has played a major role in SL because FRs are both written and entrenched. SL has emerged successfully with the concept of constitutionalism and with its practical plausibility. The written constitution adds value in terms of writtenness and entrenchment of FR and entrenchment of FR and extends to other important provisions of the constitution. The issue of ROL in its ability to set the restrictions upon the Freedoms and rights of individuals is remedied by the Sri Lankan constitution by clearly enumerating article 15 (Restriction of FRs) SL maintains its parliamentary sovereignty by Article 75 and 83 while not compromising on the supremacy of the constitution."
