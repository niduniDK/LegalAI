# Test Checklist for Legal AI

This checklist is based on the Master Test Plan with actual tests extracted from it.

## 3.1 Testing Techniques and Types

- [ ] 3.1.1 Data and Database Integrity Testing
  - [ ] Invoke database access methods with valid data
  - [ ] Invoke database access methods with invalid data
  - [ ] Inspect database for correct data population
  - [ ] Verify database events occur properly
  - [ ] Review returned data for correct retrieval
- [ ] 3.1.2 Function Testing
  - [ ] Test process_query() function
  - [ ] Test faiss_retrieve() function
  - [ ] Test get_pdfs() helper function
  - [ ] Test input validation with valid legal queries
  - [ ] Test input validation with invalid/irrelevant queries
  - [ ] Test output validation for responses
  - [ ] Verify system does not respond to irrelevant queries
  - [ ] Verify reasonable responses for legal queries
  - [ ] Verify relevant document retrieval
  - [ ] Verify document recommendations match user history
- [ ] 3.1.3 User Interface Testing
  - [ ] Test chatbot interface
  - [ ] Test search interface
  - [ ] Test recommendation interface
  - [ ] Test user history interface
  - [ ] Simulate UI with valid inputs
  - [ ] Simulate UI with invalid inputs
  - [ ] Verify accessibility of all features
  - [ ] Verify functionality of UI components
- [ ] 3.1.4 Performance Profiling
  - [ ] Test under normal anticipated workload
  - [ ] Test under worst-case workload
  - [ ] Measure response times
  - [ ] Measure transaction rates
- [ ] 3.1.5 Load Testing
  - [ ] Test varying workloads
  - [ ] Test peak loads
  - [ ] Test average loads
  - [ ] Test instantaneous peaks
  - [ ] Test sustained peaks
  - [ ] Test under different environment configurations
- [ ] 3.1.6 Security and Access Control Testing
  - [ ] Identify user types (admin, manager, user, guest)
  - [ ] Define permissions for each user type
  - [ ] Test access for each user type (allowed/denied)
  - [ ] Modify user roles and re-test permissions
  - [ ] Test login with valid credentials
  - [ ] Test login with invalid credentials
  - [ ] Test unauthorized remote/system access
- [ ] 3.1.7 Failover and Recovery Testing
  - [ ] Simulate client power loss
  - [ ] Simulate server power loss
  - [ ] Simulate network communication loss
  - [ ] Simulate DASD/device controller failures
  - [ ] Simulate interrupted processes
  - [ ] Simulate database corruption
  - [ ] Execute recovery processes
  - [ ] Verify system restoration
- [ ] 3.1.8 Configuration Testing
  - [ ] Test different hardware configurations
  - [ ] Test different software configurations
  - [ ] Test varying resource loads
  - [ ] Test with reduced memory
  - [ ] Test on different OS/hardware setups
