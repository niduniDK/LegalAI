# API Configuration
# -----------------
# Backend API URL - Required for production deployment

# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix required for Next.js browser exposure
# - Used by AuthContext for authentication API calls
# - Falls back to http://127.0.0.1:8000 if not set (local dev)
# - Other components currently hardcode localhost:8000 (works for dev only)

# For production (Backend deployed on Railway):
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend.up.railway.app

# For local development:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
# (Optional - has fallback in code)

# ===========================================
# Deployment Instructions
# ===========================================

# LOCAL DEVELOPMENT:
# 1. No .env file needed - code has fallback to localhost:8000
# 2. Or create .env.local with: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
# 3. Start backend: cd Backend && python main.py
# 4. Start frontend: npm run dev

# VERCEL PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT:
# 1. Deploy backend to Railway first
# 2. Get Railway URL from: Railway Dashboard → Your Service → Settings → Networking → Generated Domain
# 3. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
# 4. Add: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = https://your-backend.up.railway.app (use your actual Railway URL)
# 5. Apply to: Production (and optionally Preview/Development)
# 6. Redeploy to apply changes
# 7. Verify: Check browser console for API calls going to correct URL

# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - Backend must be deployed FIRST to get Railway URL
# - Update Railway FRONTEND_URL env var with your Vercel URL (for CORS)
# - Both must use HTTPS in production
# - Railway URL format: https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
# - Vercel URL format: https://your-app.vercel.app

# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# - CORS errors? Check FRONTEND_URL in Railway backend environment variables
# - 404 errors? Verify Railway backend is running and URL is correct
# - Mixed content errors? Ensure both frontend and backend use HTTPS in production
